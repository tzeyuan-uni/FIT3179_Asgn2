                The choropleth map shows the normalised confirmed cases over million units. Darker colour
                represents higher cases density per million popoulation. A population filter by millions
                is attached to allow better filter of visualisation.
                <br>
                <br>
                1. The Americas and South Asia region shows a high density cases ratio as compared to other
                regions of the world - this shows that countries with a high population density in general
                are easier for Covid-19 to be spread among households and communities.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. Countries that hosts big cities with frequent international flights with the likes of the
                United States, Russia, and a few major European cities shows high vulnerability to Covid-19.

                The treemap / marimekko chart shows the share of confirmed cases split across continents and 
                split into countries. The data is filtered to only include 48 countries with over 100,000 confirmed
                cases in 2020 that makes up of ~94% of all global cases.
                <br>
                <br>
                1. Early trend shows that Americas and Asia are reaching peak in terms of confirmed cases, closely
                followed by Europe which is expected to soar with high population density.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. Despite Africa being the smallest share at the current timestamp, we will quickly learnt that low
                healthcare standards quickly threathens the regions' virus outbreak and mutation.

            The Sankey diagram visualises the outcome of Covid-19 cases by three categories of active, decreased,
            or recovered. These are further split by regions which illustrates a better view of active/recovery
            ratio among diffreent regions of the world.
            <br>
            <br>
            1. The Americas and Europe are having near to half portions of Covid-19 patients that are quickly
            recovering or recovered from the virus, whereas Asia is lagging behind at only ~10% recovered cases
            despite being one of the earliest regions to be infected.
            <br>
            <br>
            2. This implies that quality of life, specifically healthcare offerings are crucial in the times of crisis
            where nations from better income status have better capacity in overcoming critical cases of Covid-19

            Breaking down the data into genders and age groups gives a better view on how the virus in
            infecting different types of individuals. This two sided bar charts shows Australia's confirmed cases
            across 9 different age groups.
            
            <br>
            <br>
            1. As observed from the chart, individuals from the 20-29 age groups has the highest chance of getting
            infected, whereas elderly as less likely to get infected as comparison.
            <br>
            <br>
            2. Despite the count value, we should be aware that elderly and toddlers poses huge risks when getting infected
            as the chances of recovery might be significantly lower.

                The bubble charts brings in multiple elements of the data across region, countries, confirmed cases,
                death counts, and recovered counts. This allow us to further explore any potential relationship between
                datasets that could lead to useful insights.
                
                <br>
                <br>
                1. The higher the bubble, the more confirmed cases they are for the country, hecne it makes sense for larger
                bubbles to be higher up in the chart as they naturally has more deaths
                <br>
                <br>
                2. Interestingly, there are no conclusie relationships found for this plot as all countries are near to equally
                well split across the plot area. One standout was the observation where we see the US and Brazil having identical
                confirmed cases and death counts, but Brazil is performing better with >2 times of recovered cases.
